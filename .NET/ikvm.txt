I was working on a project that required me to use a java sdk in my .NET application. Asked whether there was a Xamarin Android version of the SDK but the response was "NO". I eventually stumbled on IKVM and tried it out (it didn't solve my problem). With this, you will have access to the various functions and classes in the jar file.

1. Install chocolatey 

Visit the link below and follow the steps to install Chocolatey
https://chocolatey.org/install



2. Install ikvmc via Chocolatey using the command below or visit the link after the command

**Command   choco install ikvm

**Link      https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ikvm



3. Navigate to the jar file directory

e.g.    cd C:\Users\XYZ\Documents\Learning\Jars\test_jar



4. Type the command below to generate a dll from the jar file

ikvmc -target:library picasso.jar



5. You should see a similar display to what's below

IKVM.NET Compiler version 8.1.5717.0

note IKVMC0002: Output file is "picasso.dll"
